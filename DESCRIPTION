Description: A unified, publication-ready toolkit for modern survival and competing risks analysis. Both nonparametric estimation and direct polytomous regression of cumulative incidence functions (CIFs) were supported. 'cifcurve()' estimates survival and CIF curves with options such as conventional Greenwood-type and related estimators, and influence-function-based inference valid for weighted (IPW) analysis. 'cifplot()' and 'cifpanel()' produce high-quality survival and CIF graphics with risk tables, censoring and competing-event marks, and multi-panel or inset layouts built on 'ggplot2' and 'ggsurvfit'. 'polyreg()' performs direct polytomous regression for coherent joint modeling of all cause-specific CIFs to estimate risk ratios, odds ratios, or subdistribution hazard ratios at user-specified time points. All core functions adopt a formula-and-data syntax and return tidy and extensible outputs that integrate smoothly with 'modelsummary', 'broom', and the broader tidyverse ecosystem. Key numerical routines are implemented in C++ via 'Rcpp'.
