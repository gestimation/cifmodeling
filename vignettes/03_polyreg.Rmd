## Coherent modeling of CIFs using polytomous log odds products

In analyzing competing risks data, standard semiparametric regression modeling that treats each cause separately has two drawbacks: potential loss of information due to ignoring the correlation between causes and an incoherence in modeling that fails to ensure that the sum of cause-specific CIFs does not exceed one. Direct polytomous regression addresses these challenges by reparameterizing nuisance parameters using polytomous log odds products, which naturally enforces the sum restriction. This approach is applicable to semiparametric models with common multiplicative effects over time as well as models focused on a specific time point. 

This model is specified by three main components:

-   Nuisance model: Describes the relationship between outcomes and covariates (excluding exposure).

-   Effect measures and time points: Defines the exposure effect to be estimated and the time point of interest.

-   Censoring adjustment: Specifies strata for inverse probability weighting to adjust for dependent censoring.

## 1. Nuisance Model

The `nuisance.model` argument specifies the formula linking the outcome to covariates. Its format depends on the outcome type:

-   Competing risks or survival outcome: Use `Surv()` or `Event()` with time and status variables.

-   Binomial outcome: Use standard R formula notation.

Default event codes:

-   Competing risks outcome: 1 and 2 for event types, 0 for censoring.

-   Survival outcome: 1 for events, 0 for censoring.

-   Binomial outcome: 0 and 1.

Event codes can be customized using `code.event1`, `code.event2`, and `code.censoring`. The `outcome.type` argument must be set to:

-   Effects on CIFs at a specific time: `"competing-risk"`

-   Effects on a risk at a specific time: `"survival"`

-   Constant effects on CIFs over time: `"proportional-competing-risk"`

-   Constant effects on a risk over time: `"proportional-survival"`

-   Effects on a risk of a binomial outcome: `"binomial"`

Covariates included in `nuisance.model` should adjust for confounding factors to obtain unbiased exposure effect estimates.

## 2. Effect measures and time points

Three effect measures available:

-   Risk ratio (RR)

-   Odds ratio (OR)

-   Subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR)

Set the desired measure using `effect.measure1` and, for competing risks analysis, `effect.measure2`. The `time.point` argument specifies the follow-up time at which effects are estimated. 

## 3. Censoring adjustment

The IPCW method is used to adjust for dependent censoring. Use `strata=` to specify stratification variables. If no strata are specified, Kaplan-Meier weights are used.

## Estimator and confidence intervals

In `polyreg()`, the regression parameters are calculated by the stratified IPCW estimators, which asymptotically achieve minimum variance within a class of augmented IPCW estimators, without the computational burden of deriving augmentation terms for each cause. For confidence intervals, `polyreg()` normally chooses a single, simple method based on `outcome.type`:

-   `"competing-risk"`, `"survival"`, `"binomial"` — Wald CIs based on sandwich variance
-   `"proportional-competing-risk"`, `"proportional-survival"` — Bootstrap CIs (normal approximation)

For time-point (non-proportional) models, the default is Wald CIs using a sandwich variance directly from influence functions. If `report.boot.conf = TRUE`, the variance is instead estimated by a wild (multiplier) bootstrap applied to the influence functions (`boot.multiplier`, boot.replications), and Wald CIs are formed from that bootstrap variance. For common effects (proportional models), `boot()` refits the estimator in each replicate and forms normal-approximate CIs from the bootstrap mean and SD. If desired, BCa CIs can be requested via `boot.bca = TRUE` (only for proportional models). Users normally do not need to set any CI flags. 

## Return

This function returns a list object that includes:

-   `coefficient` — regression coefficients

-   `cov` — variance-covariance matrix for regression coefficients

-   `diagnostic.statistics` — a data frame containing inverse probability weights, influence functions, and predicted potential outcomes

-   `summary` — a summary of estimated exposure effects

Use `summary` output with `msummary()` to display formatted results. The regression coefficients and their variance-covariance matrix are provided as `coefficient` and `cov`, respectively, with the first element corresponding to the intercept term, subsequent elements to the covariates in `nuisance.model`, and the last element to the variable specified by `exposure=`. Finally, `diagnostic.statistics` is a data frame containing inverse probability weights, influence functions, and predicted values of the potential outcomes of individual observations.
