\title{Create a survival or competing risks response}
\usage{
Event(time, event)
}
\arguments{
\item{time}{Numeric vector of follow-up times (non-negative).}

\item{event}{Integer or factor vector of event codes
(e.g., 0 = censored, 1 = event of interest, 2 = competing event).}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"Event"} with fields \code{time}, \code{event}
}
\description{
A lightweight response constructor used in \code{survival.curve()} and \code{polyreg()}
to pass survival and competing risks data via a model formula.
}
\examples{
data(diabetes.complications)
polyreg(
  nuisance.model = Event(t, epsilon) ~ +1,
  exposure = "fruitq1",
  data = diabetes.complications,
  effect.measure1 = "RR",
  effect.measure2 = "RR",
  time.point = 8,
  outcome.type = "COMPETING-RISK"
)
